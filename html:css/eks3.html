    <h1>An important notice regarding US customer information</h1>
    <p>09.02.22 / CORPORATE</p>
        <p>
        Today, we are taking a moment to inform our customers that we recently discovered
        a cybersecurity incident that affected some of their information.

        We want to assure our customers that the issue did not impact Social Security 
        numbers or credit and debit card numbers, but in some cases, may have affected 
        information such as name, contact and demographic information, date of birth, 
        and product registration information. The information affected for each relevant 
        customer may vary.
        </p>

                <p>
                    Samsung detected the incident and has taken actions to secure the 
                    affected systems. As part of our ongoing investigation, we have 
                    engaged a leading outside cybersecurity firm and are coordinating 
                    with law enforcement. We are notifying customers to make them aware 
                    of this matter.

                    is why the security and privacy of our customers’ data is of the 
                    utmost importance to us, and our products and services are designed
