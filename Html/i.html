            <h2>Radiationtherapy</h2>
                <p>FLASH radiotherapy is a new form of radiation treatment developed by researchers at
                the University Hospital in Lausanne. 
                The method has proven to be very effective in the treatment of cancer, 
                while also sparing the adjacent healthy tissues to a remarkable degree. 
                Biltema Foundation has now donated 260 million to the project to further 
                develop this revolutionary method for cancer treatment.</p>
